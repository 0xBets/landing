            remember that when you use a link to go from the Services to another
            website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing
            and interaction on any other website, including those that have a
            link on our platform, is subject to that website’s own rules and

            enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are
            non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain
            functionality like videos may become unavailable or you would be
            required to enter your login details every time you visit the
            website as we would not be able to remember that you had logged in
            previously. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of
            Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to
            access functionality on our website correctly or at all. We never
